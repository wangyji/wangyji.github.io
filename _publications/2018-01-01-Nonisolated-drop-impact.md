Upon impact on a solid surface, a drop expands into a sheet, a corona, which can rebound, stick or splash and fragment into secondary droplets. Previously, focus has been placed on impacts of single drops on surfaces to understand their splash, rebound or spreading. This is important for spraying, printing, and environmental and health processes such as contamination by pathogen-bearing droplets. However, sessile drops are ubiquitous on most surfaces and their interaction with the impacting drop is largely unknown. We report on the regimes of interactions between an impacting drop and a sessile drop. Combining experiments and theory, we derive the existence conditions for the four regimes of drop–drop interaction identified, and report that a subtle combination of geometry and momentum transfer determines a critical impact force governing their physics. Crescent-moon fragmentation is most efficient at producing and projecting secondary droplets, even when the impacting drop Weber number would not allow for splash to occur on the surface considered if the drop were isolated. We introduce a critical horizontal impact Weber number  that governs the formation of a sheet from the sessile drop upon collision with the expanding corona of the impacting drop. We also predict and validate important properties of the crescent-moon fragmentation: the extension of its sheet base and the ligaments surrounding its base. Finally, our results suggest a new paradigm: impacts on most surfaces can make a splash of a new kind – a crescent-moon – for any impact velocity when neighbouring sessile drops are present.
