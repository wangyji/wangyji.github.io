We present the results of a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of sheet evolution, expansion and retraction, under unsteady fragmentation upon drop impact on a surface of comparable size to that of the drop. We quantify and model the effect of the continuous time-varying – unsteady – shedding of droplets from the sheet via its bounding rim. We present and validate especially developed advanced image processing algorithms that quantify, with high accuracy, the key quantities involved in such unsteady fragmentation, from sheet, to rim, to ligaments, to droplet properties. With these high precision measurements, we show the important effect of continuous unsteady droplet shedding on the sheet dynamics. We combine experiments and theory to derive and validate governing equations of the sheet that incorporate such continuous shedding – associated with continuous loss of momentum and mass – from unsteady fragmentation. Combining this theory with the universal unsteady rim dynamics discovered in Wang <i>et al.</i> (Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 120, 2018, 204503), we show that the governing equation of the sheet can be reduced to a continuous-shedding, non-Galilean Taylor–Culick law, from which we deduce new analytical expressions for the time evolution of the sheet radius. We show the robustness of the predictions to changes of fluid properties, including surface tension and moderate fluid viscosity and elasticity, including use of physiological mucosalivary fluid. We also reconcile prior literature's inconsistent experimental results on the sheet dynamics upon drop impact.
