Antarctic ice shelves buttress the grounded ice sheet, mitigating global sea-level rise. However, fundamental mechanical properties, such as the ice flow law and viscosity structure, remain under debate. Here, leveraging remote-sensing data and physics-informed deep learning, we provide evidence over several ice shelves that the flow law follows a grain-size sensitive composite rheology in the compression zone. Conversely, in the extension zone, we find that ice exhibits anisotropic properties. We construct ice-shelf-wide anisotropic viscosity maps that capture the suture zones, which inhibit rift propagation. The inferred stress exponent near the grounding zone dictates the grounding-line ice flux and grounding line stability, while the inferred viscosity maps inform the prediction of rifts. Both are essential for predicting the future mass loss of the Antarctic Ice Sheet.
