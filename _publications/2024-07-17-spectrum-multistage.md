Deep learning frameworks have become power- ful tools for approaching scientific problems such as turbulent flow, which has wide-ranging appli- cations. In practice, however, existing scientific machine learning approaches have difficulty fit- ting complex, multi-scale dynamical systems to very high precision, as required in scientific con- texts. We propose using the novel multistage neu- ral network approach with a spectrum-informed initialization to learn the residue from the previ- ous stage, utilizing the spectral biases associated with neural networks to capture high frequency features in the residue, and successfully tackle the spectral bias of neural networks. This ap- proach allows the neural network to fit target func- tions to double floating-point machine precision $O(10^16)$.
